        <h1>List of Books to<br>Read on a Cozy<br> Sunday Afternoon</h1>
        <p>When fall comes and the days grow shorter, there's nothing more comforting than a warm blanket and a good book—maybe even a woodsy candle or two to add to the atmosphere. So, as the trees change to a warm hue, swap out your summer reading list for the best books to cuddle up with during a cozy Autumn weekend.</p>
        <p>Anne of Green Gables</p>
        <p>A perfect way to start off the list, a book which can take you into its world of adventure, Anne of Green Gables. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthbert’s Farm on Prince Edward Island, she is a precocious, romantic child, desperate to be loved, and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. Anne moves from one mishap to another as her wild imagination and far-fetched antics combine to constantly bring trouble upon her shoulders. While this book is purely fiction, it has ties with reality, which makes it even more interesting to dive into.</p>
        <p>The Catcher in the Rye</p>
        <p>Published in 1951, The novel details two days in the life of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield after he has been expelled from prep school. Confused and disillusioned, Holden searches for truth and rails against the “phoniness” of the adult world. The Catcher in the Rye takes the loss of innocence as its primary concern. Holden wants to be the “catcher in the rye”—someone who saves children from falling off a cliff, which can be understood as a metaphor for entering adulthood. It’s a great read which can open your eyes to the type of world we live in.</p>
        <p>Little Women</p>
        <p>This warming coming-of-age novel follows four sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March. They are raised in genteel poverty by their loving mother, Marmee, in a quiet Massachusetts town while their father serves as an army chaplain during the American Civil War. The vital force of the family is Jo, a headstrong tomboy who is the emotional centre of the book. In the course of this novel, we watch as these four sisters grow and enter the age of womanhood.</p>
        <p>Great Expectations</p>
        <p>This novel, published in book form in 1861, chronicles the coming of age of the orphan Philip Pirrip while also addressing such issues as social class and human worth. He grows up in the marshlands of Kent, where he lives with his disagreeable sister and her sweet-natured husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. The classic novel was one of its author’s greatest critical and popular successes, and is definitely worth a read.</p>
        <p>Siddhartha</p>
        <p>Inspired by the author’s visit to India before World War I, the theme of the novel is the search for self-realization by a young Brahman, Siddhartha. Realizing the contradictions between reality and what he has been taught, he abandons his comfortable life to wander. His goal is to find the serenity that will enable him to defeat fear and to experience with equanimity the contrasts of life, including joy and sorrow, life and death. Despairing of finding fulfillment, he goes to the river and there learns simply to listen. He discovers within himself a spirit of love and learns to accept human separateness. In the end, Siddhartha grasps the wholeness of life and achieves a state of bliss and highest wisdom.</p>
